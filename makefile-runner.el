;;; makefile-runner.el --- Searches for Makefile and fetches targets

;; Copyright (C) 2009-2012 Dan Amlund Thomsen

;; Author: Dan Amlund Thomsen <dan@danamlund.dk>
;; URL: http://danamlund.dk/emacs/make-runner.html
;; Version: 1.1.2
;; Created: 2009-01-01
;; By: Dan Amlund Thomsen
;; Keywords: makefile, make, ant, build

;;; Commentary:

;; An easy method of running different makefiles. The function searches current
;; and parent directories for a makefile, fetches targets, and asks
;; the user which of the targets to run.

;; The function is `makefile-runner'.

;; By default it supports make's Makefiles and ant's build.xml files.

;;; Installation:

;; Save makefile-runner.el to your load path and add the following to
;; your .emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'makefile-runner)

;; You can add a keybinding to run the function, for example:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "F11") 'makefile-runner)

;;; Customization:

;; M-x customize-group makefile-runner
;;
;; You can add further build systems by changing
;; `makefile-runner--makefiles'.
;;
;; And you can set a specific Makefile to use by changing
;; `makefile-runner--makefile'. A better method is to add a
;; file-variable to the affected files. For example, add to following
;; to the start of foo/src/foo.c:
;;
;; /* -*- makefile-runner--makefile: "../Makefile" -*- */

;;; Changelog:
;; (2012-09-29) 1.1.2: Now also searches for makefiles next to the current file
;; (2012-09-29) 1.1.1: Better handles no-makefile-found.
;; (2012-09-29) 1.1.0: Added ant support. minibuffer now shows
;;                     makefile filename and its directory-name.
